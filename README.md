# DAGViewPager

`ViewPager` is the most commonly used view when dealing with flows. Almost every app has some sort of account creation or onboarding flow for new users. Or may be your app requires that user answers few questions before you can create a specialized experience for them e.g. news or magazine apps. Or it could simply be that your app heavily relies on survey forms/questionnaires that your users fill to receive rewards.

This app tries to ease such complex flows using Directed Acyclic Graph. This is bare minimum code to get you started.
